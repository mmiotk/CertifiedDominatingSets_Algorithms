## Overview

This repository hosts two programs designed for solving the certified domination problem using `SageMath`, a robust mathematical software, and can also be utilized using the `R` programming language.

### Programs
1. **linear_trees.py**
   - Implements a linear algorithm for tree structures in the domination problem.
2. **certified_ILP.py**
   - Solves the domination problem using Integer Linear Programming (ILP).
3. **linearTreesR.R**
   - Implements a linear algorithm for tree structures in the domination problem.
4. **certified_ILP.R**
   - Solves the domination problem using Integer Linear Programming (ILP).
     

## Prerequisites
- [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) installation is required to run the programs in this repository.
- Installation of the R programming language.
