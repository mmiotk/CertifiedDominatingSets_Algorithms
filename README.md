## Overview
This repository hosts two programs designed for solving the certified domination problem using `SageMath`, a robust mathematical software.

### Programs
1. **linear_trees.py**
   - Implements a linear algorithm for tree structures in the domination problem.
2. **Certified_ILP.py**
   - Solves the domination problem using Integer Linear Programming (ILP).

## Prerequisites
- [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) installation is required to run the programs in this repository.

## Running the Programs

### Linear Algorithm for Trees
To run `linear_trees.py`:
1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the file.
3. Execute the script with SageMath:
   ```bash
   sage linear_trees.py
   
###   Integer Linear Programming for Domination Problem
To run `certified_ILP.py`:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the file.
3. Execute the script with SageMath:
